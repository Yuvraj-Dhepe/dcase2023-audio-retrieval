### **Evaluation of the Steps**

#### **Step 1**: _Divide the original dataset into non-random 10 splits_

- This ensures that the dataset splits are fixed and independent of randomization, allowing you to evaluate the variability introduced solely by random seed in subsequent steps.
- This step is valid and necessary for fair benchmarking.

#### **Step 2**: _For each of the 10 splits, select 3x samples randomly via 2 different seeds_

- Introducing two random seeds provides a basis to assess whether the choice of seed causes significant differences in the sampled data and its impact on model training.
- Random sampling within fixed splits introduces controlled randomness, which is essential for testing variability due to random seeds.

#### **Step 3**: _Train 10 models for each random seed on the created 10 random splits_

- This creates a robust experimental setup with enough data points (20 models) for statistical analysis.
- Training multiple models on the same splits with different seeds ensures that the variability attributed to random initialization or data sampling is captured.

#### **Step 4**: _Evaluate the performance of the model on the evaluation set_

- Using a fixed evaluation set ensures consistency in assessing model performance and avoids conflating seed variability with evaluation data variability.
- It provides a common ground for comparing the performance across all trained models.

#### **Step 5**: _Run a 2-sided t-test on the 20 evaluation metric values, 10 per random seed_

- A 2-sided t-test is appropriate to test whether the differences in evaluation metrics between the two seeds are statistically significant.
- This approach provides a quantitative measure of the influence of random seeds on performance.

### **Suitability**

1. **Scientific Rigor**:
   The experiment is designed with sufficient replicates and controlled variables, adhering to best practices in machine learning research. This will strengthen the credibility of your results.

2. **Novelty and Relevance**:
   Assessing the impact of random seeds on model performance is a critical and under-explored topic in reproducibility and robustness research. It directly addresses concerns in the field about the variability of results due to seemingly insignificant factors.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   Including hypothesis testing (2-sided t-test) demonstrates your ability to incorporate statistical techniques to validate your findings, which is expected at the master's level.

4. **Practical Insights**:
   Your findings will provide practical insights into whether the choice of random seed matters and to what extent it affects performance. This is highly relevant for practitioners aiming to replicate and trust machine learning models.

### **Suggestions for Improvement**

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use multiple evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.) to provide a comprehensive understanding of performance variability.
- **Effect Size**: In addition to the p-value from the t-test, consider reporting effect size (e.g., Cohenâ€™s d) to quantify the magnitude of differences.
- **Visualization**: Include visualizations such as box plots or violin plots to illustrate the distribution of evaluation metrics across random seeds.
- **Seed Sensitivity Analysis**: Extend the analysis to test more than two seeds to generalize your conclusions.
